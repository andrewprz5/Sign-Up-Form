# Sign-Up-Form

This project is a simple sign-up form for a service that allows users to input their 
information, which then becomes validated and sent to the back-end server. There will be 
different input types that specify what kind of text/information is expected from the user,
otherwise it will not be validated, which is key to making sure the back-end server
receives the right information. HTML and CSS are used in this project, no Javascript. 
Specific types of pseudo-classes will be included in the CSS page to style the inputs/
labels, such as when the user enters valid/invalid data and when an input is focused or 
out-of-focused.
